Mellowtel allows you to monetize your browser plugins, Flutter and Electron apps.

Through the Open-Source library, your users can decide to share a fraction of their unused internet. Trusted partners â€” from startups to enterprises â€” access the internet to retrieve publicly available data from websites and you get a share of the revenue. The revenue split is 55% to developers and 45% to Mellowtel. As we scale we will be able to offer more services and increase the revenue for you.
Down the line there might be features so that you can share part of this revenue with your users.

This is the Mellowtel documentation. It's a great place to find most answers. If you have other questions, need help or want to be part of our community please join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/txAZp4MSDe).
