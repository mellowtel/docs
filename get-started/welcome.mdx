Mellowtel is the open-source monetization platform for developers and creators in the AI world.

Your users can decide to share a fraction of their internet bandwidth. Trusted partners â€” from startups to enterprises â€” access the internet to retrieve publicly available data from websites and you get a share of the revenue they pay. The revenue split is 55% to developers and 45% to Mellowtel. As we scale we will be able to offer more services and increase the revenue for you.
Down the line there might be features so that you can share part of this revenue with your users. In the meantime you can give exclusive features and content to reward them for supporting you.

This is the Mellowtel documentation. It's a great place to find most answers. If you have other questions, need help or want to be part of our community please join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/txAZp4MSDe).
