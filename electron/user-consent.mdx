## Introduction

In order to activate Mellowtel, users must give their explicit consent. The package provides a way to opt in or opt out. The core idea is that since it's their unused Internet bandwidth, they should decide if they want to share it or not.

Users can provide their consent via a consent settings dialog.

### Consent Dialog Configuration

The consent dialog is a crucial part of the Mellowtel integration. It ensures that users are fully informed and provide explicit consent before sharing their unused internet bandwidth.

You can define the consent dialog configuration when creating an instance of `Mellowtel`
