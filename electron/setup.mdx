This is a work in progress. We will soon update our docs.

Mellowtel is currently supported for Electron apps on iOS.

Remember to replace <your_configuration_key> with your actual Mellowtel configuration key. If you donâ€™t have a configuration key yet, you can get one by signing up at Mellowtel.

Estimated time to complete: 5-10 minutes.
