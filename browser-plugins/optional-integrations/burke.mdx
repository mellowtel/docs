Mellowtel provides an optional feature that allows you to handle more requests and therefore earn more. This feature is called "Burke".

Below are instructions for enabling the Burke feature in your browser plugin, with options for both standard and Plasmo framework implementations.

## Standard Implementation

### 1. Create a JavaScript file named `burke.js`

In the src directory, or wherever you have js files, create a file named `burke.js` and add the following code. Ensure this file gets included in your final build (/dist) directory:

```javascript
import Mellowtel from "mellowtel";

let mellowtel;

(async () => {
    mellowtel = new Mellowtel("<configuration_key>"); // Replace with your configuration key
    await mellowtel.initBurke();
})();
```

### 3. Update manifest.json

Add the `burke.js` file to your `manifest.json` as web_accessible_resources:

```json
{
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [
        "burke.js"
      ],
      "matches": [ "<all_urls>" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Plasmo Framework Implementation

The implementation is the same as the standard implementation. If you have any issues, contact us via Discord.

## Update initContentScript

For both implementations, modify your `initContentScript` method in the content script to include the correct path to the Burke file:

- For standard implementation: `initContentScript("", "burke.js");`
- For Plasmo framework: `initContentScript("", "burke.js");`

If you also have `Pascoli` enabled, the first parameter should be the name of the `pascoli.html` file.
