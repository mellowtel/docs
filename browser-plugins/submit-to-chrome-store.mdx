After you are done following the instructions to import Mellowtel in your extension that have been outlined in [Quick Start](/browser-plugins/quickstart) you are ready to submit your extension to the web Store.
This guide will help you submit your extension to the Chrome Web Store.

Estimated time to complete: 3-5 minutes.


### Web Store Justification
The Web Store requires you to justify the permissions you are requesting. Here is a template you can use (it explains how Mellowtel uses the permissions):

**DeclarativeNetRequest**:
```txt
The declarativeNetRequest permission is required to strip certain headers (e.g. X-Frame headers) from some responses on the sub_frame level. This allows displaying websites in an iframe without running into issues related to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). These headers are immediately restored after the response is processed.
```

**Host Permissions**:
```txt
The host permissions on all_urls are required to let declarativeNetRequest modify response headers on all URLs. This is necessary to strip certain headers (e.g. X-Frame headers) from some responses on the sub_frame level. This allows displaying websites in an iframe without running into issues related to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). These headers are immediately restored after the response is processed.
```

**Storage**:
```txt
The storage permissions is required to persist state specific to the extension and have a local logic to facilitate communications across the various parts of the extension.
```
