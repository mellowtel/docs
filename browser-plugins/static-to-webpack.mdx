This guide outlines how to set up your browser extension project with Webpack, focusing on a configuration that supports multiple JavaScript entry points and static asset management.

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup

Start by structuring your project to accommodate source files, static assets, and the eventual bundled output. Your project directory should look something like this:

```
your-extension/
├── public/            # Contains static files like HTML, CSS, and the manifest
│   ├── images/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── popup.html
├── src/               # Contains your JavaScript source code
│   ├── background.js
│   ├── popup.js
│   ├── content_script.js
│   └── ... (any other JS files)
└── package.json       # NPM package file
```

### Step 2: Setting Up Node.js and NPM

Ensure Node.js and NPM are installed on your system. Node.js is essential for running the package ecosystem, and NPM is used to manage your project's dependencies.

### Step 3: Installing Webpack and Other Dependencies

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and initialize a new NPM project if you haven't already:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then, install Webpack and the necessary loaders and plugins:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env copy-webpack-plugin file-loader
```

- **Webpack** bundles your JavaScript and assets.
- **Babel** allows you to use modern JavaScript features.
- **CopyPlugin** copies files and directories into your build directory.
- **File Loader** resolves import/require() on a file into a url and emits the file into the output directory.

### Step 4: Configuring Webpack

Create a `webpack.config.js` file in your project root. This file should define your entry points, output configuration, module rules for loading different file types, and plugins for additional functionality. Here's how your `webpack.config.js` should look with the given setup:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'development', // Use 'production' for production builds
    entry: {
        background: path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'background.js'),
        popup: path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'popup.js'),
        content_script: path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'content_script.js'),
    },
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: '[name].js',
        publicPath: ""
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/
            },
            {
                test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,
                use: [
                    'file-loader',
                ],
            },
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new CopyPlugin({
            patterns: [
                { from: 'public', to: '' } // Copy all assets and the manifest.json from 'public' to 'dist'
            ],
        }),
    ]
};
```

### Step 5: Adjusting the Manifest and HTML Files

Ensure your `manifest.json` and any HTML files reference the scripts and assets correctly. For example, scripts will be output to the `dist` folder, so update paths accordingly.

### Step 6: Integrating Build Scripts into `package.json`

After setting up your project with Webpack and configuring it as described in the previous steps, you’ll want to automate the build and watch processes using `npm` scripts. Open your `package.json` file and add the following scripts within the `scripts` object:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "build": "webpack --mode production",
  "watch": "webpack --mode development --watch"
},
```

Here’s what each script does:
- `"build"`: Bundles your extension in production mode, optimizing the output for deployment. This mode enables optimizations like minification and dead code elimination.
- `"watch"`: Runs Webpack in development mode and watches your files for changes, automatically recompiling the project when a file is modified. This is helpful during development for immediate feedback on changes.

### Step 7: Testing & Building the Extension

To build your extension for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command invokes Webpack with the `--mode production` flag, optimizing your project for deployment.

For development, you can have Webpack watch your files and recompile whenever changes are detected:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This makes the development process smoother, as you don’t have to manually rebuild the project after each change.

### Step 7: Testing the Extension

To test your extension in Chrome:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in the Chrome browser.
2. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your `dist` folder.

This will install the extension locally for testing and development purposes.
