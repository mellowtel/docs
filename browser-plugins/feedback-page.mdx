Mellowtel provides a pre-built feedback page that you can use to collect feedback from your users so you can iterate faster and improve your product.
Right now the page is available only for browser plugins.


## Add the method to Your Extension

The feedback page is hosted by Mellowtel and is accessible via a URL that you can generate using the `generateFeedbackLink()` method from the Mellowtel JS package.

If you want to directly open the feedback page in a new tab, you can use the `generateAndOpenFeedbackLink()` method and it will open a page similar to this [one](https://www.mellowtel.com/uninstall-feedback/?extension_id=testId&configuration_key=testConfiguration). dynamically passing your plugin icon and name.
