## Introduction
Every user is assigned a random identifier not linked to any personal information. This ensures total anonymity.

Every request gets loaded in a sandboxed environment. You can look at the implementation as it's open-source on [Github](https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/), so no personal information is shared (no cookies, local storage, etc).
Basically it's like the requests are being handled in an incognito tab that is not linked to the user's instance.
