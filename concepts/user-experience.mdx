## Explanation
When you build a product, you want to make sure that it doesn't negatively affect the user experience.
Products should always add value to the user, and not take away from it. One core principle is making them as unobtrusive as possible.

When you import Mellowtel, you can be sure that it won't negatively affect the user experience. It's designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.

It uses an array of optimizations under the hood (such as making the request in a window that gets immediately removed) to ensure that it doesn't slow down the user's browsing experience.
Another feature that helps keep the library unobtrusive is Rate Limiting. This ensures that the library doesn't make too many requests in a short period of time.

You can read more about rate limiting [here](/concepts/rate-limiting).
