## NuGet CLI Setup

To integrate Mellowtel into your Flutter applications on Windows, you need the NuGet CLI tool. Follow these steps:

1. Download `nuget.exe` from [NuGet CLI download page](https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
2. Create a folder (e.g., `C:\Tools\NuGet`) and place `nuget.exe` there
3. Add the folder to your Windows PATH:
   - Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
   - Under System Variables, edit Path
   - Add the folder path (e.g., `C:\Tools\NuGet`)
4. Verify installation by running `nuget` in a new terminal
