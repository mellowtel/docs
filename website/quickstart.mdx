Integrate Mellowtel into your website to allow users to support you

## Prerequisites

- A Mellowtel account
- Basic knowledge of HTML/JavaScript

## Installation

1. Sign up for a Mellowtel account if you haven't already
2. Get your INVITE_ID from the Mellowtel dashboard
3. Add the Mellowtel script to your website's HTML:

```html
<!-- Replace INVITE_ID with the one you get when you create a support link from the dashboard -->
<script 
  src="https://cdn.mellow.tel/widget.js?type=button&position=bottom-right&invite_id=INVITE_ID">
</script>

```

You can preview different widget designs at:

https://cdn.mellow.tel/preview?position=bottom-right&type=button&invite_id=ijxf49s9h2f

## Configuration

This script will display a button, icon or banner, depending on your choice, within your website. If a user click on it they will be redirected to install a plugin (and in the near future an app).
Thanks to your INVITE_ID we know they want to support you so we can assign you the earnings for requests handled by them.




Estimated time to complete: 5-10 minutes.
